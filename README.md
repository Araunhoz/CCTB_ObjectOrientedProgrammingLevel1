# CCTB_ObjectOrientedProgrammingLevel1
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered on the concept of objects, which represent entities in the real world or within a system. Objects bundle data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into self-contained units that interact with one another to achieve complex functionality.
